# SORTING ALGORITHMS

When asked the best way to sort a million integers, Barack Obama said ``I don't know but I think Bubble sort will be the wrong way to go``. Even then he knew how unimportant bubble sort was to his election campaign :laughing:. Sorting algorithms are the various algorithms used to sort pools of data. Like Jesus said ***sorting the wheat from the chaff***. These algorithms can be a simple as what you do to find the name in the phone book or to arrange your shoopping list in order ofpreference ***or cost*** :joy:. In this repository I will be taking you across numerous no 13 sorting algorithms from the infamous **bubble sort** which Knuth said had nothing but a catchy name to the eerie **bitonic sort** which arranges its items at the subatomic level
Below are the sorting algorithms treated here:

* **Bitonic sort**
* **Bubble sort:**
  It's very simple logic. if my next is smaller than me, switch till he is not and i move forward. If i;m at the end, start from the beginning till we're set. Kind of like how we arrange lines in the parade. It's not really that bad, it's just slow.
* **Cocktail shaker sort**
* **Counting sort**
* **Heap sort**
* **Insertion sort**
* **Merge sort**
* **Quick sort** ``Lomuto's partition``
* **Quick sort** ``Hoare's partition``
* **Radix sort**
* **Selection sort**
* **Shell sort**
